# Exponential-Smoothing-Algorithm
the py file contents 3 algorithms:simple exponential smoothing, trend exponential smoothing and holt-winter.
the simple exponential smoothing algorithms is always used to predict the time series without trend and peroid.
the tend exponential smoothing algorithms is used to predict time series with trend.
the holtwinters algorithms is used to predict time series with peroid.
